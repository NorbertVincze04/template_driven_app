# Backend

This is the backend service for the template-driven app.

## Features

- Node.js + TypeScript server
- Express-style API setup
- PostgreSQL integration support
- Environment-based configuration

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in this directory and add your environment variables, for example:

   ```env
    PORT=3000

    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USER=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    DB_NAME=your_db_name

    JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_generated_code
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d # can be changed
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:4200
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure

```bash

```

## Scripts

- `npm start` — runs the backend server
- `npm run build` — compiles TypeScript

## Notes

Update the environment variables and database configuration to match your local or deployment setup.

## Database setup

Open `sql/001_multi_tenant_schema.sql` in pgAdmin Query Tool and execute it against
your application database. It creates the tenant-aware `shops`, `shop_domains`, and
`users` tables and seeds the `default` tenant for `localhost`.

For appointments and barber profiles, execute the migrations in order after the
initial schema:

```text
sql/002_profile_and_appointments.sql
sql/003_profile_image_position.sql
sql/004_barber_scheduling_and_guest_appointments.sql
sql/005_barber_services.sql
```

The last two migrations create working hours, blocked periods, service prices,
barber-owned services, guest booking fields, and appointment overlap protection.

The `shops.config` JSONB column stores the website configuration. To add another
tenant, insert a shop and map one or more domains:

```sql
INSERT INTO shops (slug, name, config)
VALUES ('acme', 'Acme Salon', '{"tenantId":"acme","name":"Acme Salon"}');

INSERT INTO shop_domains (shop_id, domain, is_primary)
SELECT id, 'acme.example.com', TRUE FROM shops WHERE slug = 'acme';
```

## Tenant routing

The public tenant config endpoint is `GET /api/tenant/config`. The frontend sends
`X-Tenant-Domain` with the browser hostname. Authentication requests send
`X-Tenant-Slug`, which is resolved against the same tenant row.

Every authentication request must include the active salon slug:

```http
X-Tenant-Slug: joesbarber
```

The backend resolves that value against an active row in `shops`, then scopes every user lookup and insert by the resolved `shop_id`. A user can therefore use the same email address at different salons.

Custom domains are stored in `shop_domains`, so no reverse-proxy mapping is needed.
For a frontend and API on different hosts, keep the browser domain header on the
tenant config request and use the returned slug for auth. Do not accept a client-
supplied `shop_id`; only the server-resolved shop is trusted.

Public registration creates a `CUSTOMER`. `ADMIN` and `BARBER` accounts should be provisioned by a trusted shop-management flow.
